    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Originally from Eugene, Oregon, I earned my BA in Psychology from Colorado College (CC) in 2017.
        At CC, I studied behavioral design, and researcheed how to motivate people to engage in habits that are 
        good for them, for society, and good for their communities. My research on desigining a theory-driven 
        waste console that resulted in better waste management practices earned me a distinction in psychology 
        from Colorado College in 2017. 
        <br>
        This goal--of understanding why people engage in behavior that is bad for them and/or bad for society,
        and then nudging them towards pro-social habits--motivates my work today. In our computer-driven world,
        many of the habits people engage in are virtual, and an understanding of computer coding will allow me to 
        pursue this passion in a domain that can influence a wide audience. Applications that encourage healthy lifestyles,
        promote community building, or create safer schools, if directed by psychologiccal research, can have far-reaching 
        effects. With an integration of technology and an understanding of the way people think and behave, we can support 
        the lives we strive for.
