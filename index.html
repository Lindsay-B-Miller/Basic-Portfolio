        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Originally from Eugene, Oregon, I earned my BA in Psychology from Colorado College (CC) in 2017.
            At CC, I studied behavioral design, and researcheed how to motivate people to engage in habits that are 
            good for them, for society, and good for their communities. My research on desigining a theory-driven 
            waste console that resulted in better waste management practices earned me a distinction in psychology 
            from Colorado College in 2017. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This goal--of understanding why people engage in behavior that is bad for them and/or bad for society,
            and then nudging them towards pro-social habits--motivates my work today. In our computer-driven world,
            many of the habits people engage in are virtual, and an understanding of computer coding will allow me to 
            pursue this passion in a domain that can influence a wide audience. Applications that encourage healthy lifestyles,
            promote community building, or create safer schools, if directed by psychologiccal research, can have far-reaching 
            effects. With an integration of technology and an understanding of the way people think and behave, we can support 
            the lives we strive for.
